      <p>Lighting isn't just about brightening a room, it sets the mood, adds beauty, and can even save energy. At D.P Electricals, we create custom lighting setups that make your home feel warm, stylish, and practical.</p>
      
      <p>Good lighting design is both an art and a science. It's about choosing the right color tones, picking the right lights, and using smart technology to make life easier. Our team understands all of this and helps you find lighting that fits your lifestyle.</p>
      
      <p>Color temperature is key, it affects how a space feels. Want a cozy vibe in the living room? Go with warm light. Need focus in the kitchen? Cool, bright light works best. We help you pick the right tone for every area.</p>
      
      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4 text-orange-600">The Science Behind Lighting Design</h2>
      
      <p>Understanding the technical aspects of lighting is crucial for creating effective designs. Lumens measure the total amount of visible light emitted by a source, while lux measures the intensity of light on a surface. For optimal visibility and comfort, different areas of your home require different lux levels:</p>
      
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-6">
        <li>Living rooms: 100-200 lux for general ambience</li>
        <li>Kitchens: 300-500 lux for food preparation areas</li>
        <li>Reading areas: 500-1000 lux for detailed tasks</li>
        <li>Bathrooms: 200-300 lux for general use, 500-750 lux for grooming</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>The Color Rendering Index (CRI) is another important factor, measuring how accurately a light source reveals the colors of objects compared to natural light. For home environments, we recommend lights with a CRI of 80 or higher for the most natural color representation.</p>
      
      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4 text-orange-600">Choosing the Right Fixtures</h2>
      
      <p>Choosing the right fixtures is just as important. From elegant chandeliers to budget-friendly LEDs, we offer a variety of options and guide you in picking what fits your taste and budget.</p>
      
      <p>Our selection process considers several factors:</p>
      
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-6">
        <li>Energy efficiency and long-term cost savings</li>
        <li>Durability and warranty coverage</li>
        <li>Compatibility with existing electrical systems</li>
        <li>Aesthetic appeal and design cohesion</li>
        <li>Maintenance requirements and accessibility</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4 text-orange-600">Smart Lighting Revolution</h2>
      
      <p>Smart lighting is changing the way homes are lit. Imagine controlling your lights from your phone, setting them to turn on or off automatically, or even changing colors for a party. We make all of that possible.</p>
      
      <p>Our smart lighting solutions offer numerous benefits:</p>
      
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-6">
        <li>Remote control via smartphone apps</li>

At D.P Electricals, we specialize in designing and installing Automatic Power Factor Correction (APFC) panels that optimize your electrical efficiency and reduce energy costs.</p>
      
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4 text-orange-600">What is Power Factor?</h2>
      
      <p>Power factor is the ratio of real power (kilowatts) to apparent power (kilovolt-amperes) in an electrical system. A low power factor indicates poor utilization of electrical power, leading to higher energy costs and system inefficiencies.</p>
      
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4 text-orange-600">Why Power Factor Correction Matters</h2>
      
      <p>Improving power factor offers several benefits:</p>
      
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-6">
        <li>Reduced electricity bills through lower demand charges</li>
        <li>Improved voltage regulation and system stability</li>
        <li>Increased capacity of existing electrical infrastructure</li>
        <li>Reduced transmission and distribution losses</li>
        <li>Enhanced performance of electrical equipment</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4 text-orange-600">How APFC Panels Work</h2>
      
      <p>Automatic Power Factor Correction panels continuously monitor the power factor and automatically switch capacitor banks to maintain optimal levels:</p>
      
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-6">
        <li>Real-time monitoring of power factor and reactive power</li>
        <li>Automatic switching of capacitor banks based on demand</li>
        <li>Harmonic filtering to prevent system distortion</li>
        <li>Protection against overvoltage and overcurrent conditions</li>
        <li>Remote monitoring and control capabilities</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4 text-orange-600">APFC Panel Design Considerations</h2>
      
      <p>Our APFC panels are custom-designed for each application:</p>
      
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-6">
        <li>Load analysis to determine required correction capacity</li>
        <li>Harmonic analysis to prevent resonance issues</li>
        <li>Selection of appropriate capacitor technology</li>
        <li>Integration with existing control systems</li>
        <li>Compliance with electrical safety standards</li>
      </ul>
