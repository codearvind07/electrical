            Lighting isn't just about brightening a room, it sets the mood, adds beauty, and can even save energy. At D.P Electricals, we create custom lighting setups that make your home feel warm, stylish, and practical.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-6">
            Good lighting design is both an art and a science. It's about choosing the right color tones, picking the right lights, and using smart technology to make life easier. Our team understands all of this and helps you find lighting that fits your lifestyle.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-6">
            Color temperature is key, it affects how a space feels. Want a cozy vibe in the living room? Go with warm light. Need focus in the kitchen? Cool, bright light works best. We help you pick the right tone for every area.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4 text-orange-600">The Science Behind Lighting Design</h2>
          
          <p className="mb-6">
            Understanding the technical aspects of lighting is crucial for creating effective designs. Lumens measure the total amount of visible light emitted by a source, while lux measures the intensity of light on a surface. For optimal visibility and comfort, different areas of your home require different lux levels:
          </p>
          
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-6">
            <li>Living rooms: 100-200 lux for general ambience</li>
            <li>Kitchens: 300-500 lux for food preparation areas</li>
            <li>Reading areas: 500-1000 lux for detailed tasks</li>
            <li>Bathrooms: 200-300 lux for general use, 500-750 lux for grooming</li>
          </ul>
          
          <p className="mb-6">
            The Color Rendering Index (CRI) is another important factor, measuring how accurately a light source reveals the colors of objects compared to natural light. For home environments, we recommend lights with a CRI of 80 or higher for the most natural color representation.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4 text-orange-600">Choosing the Right Fixtures</h2>
          
          <p className="mb-6">
            Choosing the right fixtures is just as important. From elegant chandeliers to budget-friendly LEDs, we offer a variety of options and guide you in picking what fits your taste and budget.
          </p>
          
          <p className="mb-6">
            Our selection process considers several factors:
          </p>
          
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-6">

            <li>Aesthetic appeal and design cohesion</li>
            <li>Maintenance requirements and accessibility</li>
          </ul>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4 text-orange-600">Smart Lighting Revolution</h2>
          
          <p className="mb-6">

          </p>
          
          <p className="mb-6">
            Our smart lighting solutions offer numerous benefits:
          </p>
