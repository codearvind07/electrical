          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 mt-8">The Rise of IoT in Industrial Automation</h2>
          <p className="mb-6">
            The Internet of Things (IoT) is revolutionizing how industrial systems communicate and operate. Connected sensors and devices provide real-time data that enables predictive maintenance, process optimization, and enhanced operational efficiency. This connectivity allows for unprecedented visibility into system performance and enables proactive decision-making.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 mt-8">Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning Integration</h2>
          <p className="mb-6">
            AI and ML technologies are being integrated into industrial control systems to enable autonomous decision-making and optimization. These technologies can analyze vast amounts of operational data to identify patterns, predict equipment failures, and optimize processes in real-time, leading to significant improvements in productivity and cost reduction.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 mt-8">Edge Computing for Real-Time Processing</h2>
          <p className="mb-6">
            Edge computing is bringing data processing closer to the source, reducing latency and enabling faster decision-making in critical industrial applications. This approach is particularly important in safety-critical systems where milliseconds can make a significant difference in operational outcomes.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 mt-8">Cybersecurity in Automated Systems</h2>
          <p className="mb-6">
            As industrial systems become more connected, cybersecurity has become a paramount concern. Modern automation systems require robust security measures to protect against cyber threats while maintaining operational efficiency. This includes secure communication protocols, access controls, and continuous monitoring systems.
          </p>
