          <p>
            The Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) is revolutionizing how industries operate by integrating smart sensors, automation, and data analytics into their workflows.
          </p>

          <h2>1. Predictive Maintenance</h2>
          <p>
            Instead of waiting for machinery to break down, companies now use sensors and data analysis to anticipate failures. This reduces downtime and extends equipment life.
          </p>

          <h2>2. Edge Computing</h2>
          <p>
            Processing data closer to the source (the edge) means faster insights and less reliance on centralized servers. This is key in time-sensitive industrial applications.
          </p>

          <h2>3. Cybersecurity Focus</h2>
          <p>
            As devices get smarter, they also become targets. IIoT deployments now prioritize secure protocols and real-time threat detection.
          </p>

          <h2>4. Digital Twins</h2>
          <p>
            A digital twin is a virtual representation of a physical system. Companies use them to simulate, monitor, and optimize operations without disrupting actual processes.
          </p>

          <h2>5. Interoperability & Open Standards</h2>
          <p>
            IIoT systems must talk to each other. Open standards and cross-platform compatibility are crucial for seamless integration across factories and systems.
          </p>

          <p>
            As Industrial IoT continues to grow, staying on top of these trends will be essential for future-proofing operations and improving efficiency.
