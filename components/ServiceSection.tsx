The panel receives information from devices designed to detect and report fires, monitors their operational integrity and provides for automatic control of equipment and transmission of information necessary to prepare the facility for fire based on a predetermined sequence. A fire control panel is a component that offers control through a fire alarm or notification system. Throughout the building, sensors are installed. These sensors redirect information to this control panel. They include environmental changes that could detect the presence of a fire. The panel receives notification for potential for operational issues with equipment that could cause a fire. The panel also alerts the employees inside the building if a potential fire was detected or predicted.",
